# ðŸŒ± Sustainable Food Supply Chain â€“ SQL Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project models a **farm-to-table food supply chain** with a focus on **sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) metrics**.  
The database tracks farms, distributors, warehouses, shipments, and sustainability indicators such as **carbon footprint** and **food waste percentage**.  

Unlike traditional SQL projects (library, hospital, ecommerce), this project highlights how SQL can be applied to **real-world challenges** like food security, supply chain transparency, and climate change.

## ðŸ›  Database Schema  
The project includes 5 main entities:  
- **Farms** â€“ Crop type, location, certifications (Organic, FairTrade, etc.)  
- **Distributors** â€“ Transport mode, carbon emission rate  
- **Warehouses** â€“ Storage type (Cold, Dry), capacity  
- **Shipments** â€“ Movement of goods from farm â†’ distributor â†’ warehouse  
- **Sustainability Metrics** â€“ Food waste percentage, carbon footprint

## ðŸ“Š Sample Queries

### 1. Calculate carbon footprint per shipment
```sql
SELECT s.shipment_id, 
       (s.distance_km * d.carbon_emission_rate) AS carbon_footprint
FROM Shipments s
JOIN Distributors d ON s.distributor_id = d.distributor_id;

2. Find top 3 most sustainable farms

SELECT f.name, AVG(sm.carbon_footprint) AS avg_footprint
FROM Farms f
JOIN Shipments s ON f.farm_id = s.farm_id
JOIN Sustainability sm ON s.shipment_id = sm.shipment_id
GROUP BY f.name
ORDER BY avg_footprint ASC
LIMIT 3;

3. Average food waste per warehouse

SELECT w.name, AVG(sm.food_waste_percent) AS avg_waste
FROM Warehouses w
JOIN Shipments s ON w.warehouse_id = s.warehouse_id
JOIN Sustainability sm ON s.shipment_id = sm.shipment_id
GROUP BY w.name;
